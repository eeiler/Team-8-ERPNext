# Project Proposal - ERPNext
## Hypothetical Operational Environment
This is an ERP, so it’s basically responsible for consolidating company data and providing standardized functionality needed in standard business scenarios (i.e. payroll, time management, employee data collection/storage/edits/protection, etc.) 
We’re using Kiewit as the hypothetical client reference for this software. Beyond standard business practices, Kiewit will expect a drastic amount of integrations with both in-house and external software, meaning this software will be responsible for on-going security around the data exchanged between the applications used by the company. 
## System Engineering View

The system of interest is the ERPNext system as it is the bridge between multiple elements of a business. It contains sensitive information relating to user logins, vendors, and customers. It also exchanges data with other applications used by the company it’s implemented at. For our Systems Engineering View, we made a mockup showing the hypothetical interactions ERPNext would have if implemented at Kiewit. Kiewit uses many applications from its subsidiary, InEight, which are partially developed in-house, and externally. They also use other in-house software to manage everything from payroll and time, to contracts and construction projects. Beyond that, fully external software, namely the Microsoft Suite, is also utilized and integrated with all of the aforementioned applications.

## Threats
* Insider threats that could lead to damage of the system, and disclosure of sensitive information or company secrets.
* Identity spoofing is a threat of a user obtaining login information of another user and acting as that person in the system.
* Elevation of privilege would allow a lower access user to gain higher access levels and see information they are unintended to.
* ERP systems store a lot of sensitive information about customers, users, and vendors. Any unauthorized disclosure of the information is a huge threat.

## Team Motivation
We were searching for a software that was both interesting to explore, and also rich with potential security improvements across multiple parameters. ERPNext can span across many systems in a company so it carries security issues of protecting any sensitive information that system has given to ERPNext. Erik and Jake both have previous work with SAP and as this software is the “open source alternative to SAP”, the topic of an ERP system is familiar.
