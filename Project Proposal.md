*Insert Description*
## Threats
* Insider threats that could lead to damage of the system, and disclosure of sensitive information or company secrets.
* Identity spoofing is a threat of a user obtaining login information of another user and acting as that person in the system.
* Elevation of privilege would allow a lower access user to gain higher access levels and see information they are unintended to.
* ERP systems store a lot of sensitive information about customers, users, and vendors. Any unauthorized disclosure of the information is a huge threat.
## Security Features

## Team Motivation
We were searching for a software that was both interesting to explore, and also rich with potential security improvements across multiple parameters. ERPNext can span across many systems in a company so it carries security issues of protecting any sensitive information that system has given to ERPNext. Erik and Jake both have previous work with SAP and as this software is the “open source alternative to SAP”, the topic of an ERP system is familiar.
