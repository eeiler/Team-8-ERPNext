# Code Analysis
## Part 1: Code Review
### Strategy
### A short summary of your code review strategy.
#### What challenges did you anticipate and how did your code review strategy attempt to address those challenges?
Our strategy for this code analysis was to focus on the areas of ERPNext that we identified potential vulnerabilities in in our previous deliverables. This helped combat our largest concern, which was the sheer size of the code base of any ERP software. While we planned to limit our manual reviews to those previously identified areas, we didn't want to ignore all the other areas completely, so we ran automated code scanners on the entire codebase, as well as the framework its built on Frappe. To be extra safe, we re-ran the scanners on the potentially vulnerable components individually, to make sure we didn't allow them to miss anything specific or miniscule.
### Findings from manual code review of critical security functions identified in misuse cases, assurance cases, and threat models.
### Findings from automated code scanning (if available). Include links to full reports.
## Part 2: Key Findings and Contributions
### Summary of key findings from manual and/or automated scanning. This summary should include mappings to CWEs to describe categories of major findings.
### Planned or ongoing contributions to the upstream open-source project (documentation, design changes, code changes, communications, etc.) These can be based on any of the prior assignments in the class.
