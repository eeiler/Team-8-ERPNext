# Team 8 ERPNext
This is the repository for Team 8 in the Software Assurance class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. We are currently working on the open source project ERPNext. Our goals are to learn how to correctly contribute and participate in an OSS community, and be able to analyze the security requirements of a software. We aim to contribute to the security of ERPNext and its documentation.
